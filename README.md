# Project WPR281 - Interactive Course Website

## 📖 Project Overview

This project was developed for a Belgium Campus startup. The goal is to create an interactive course website that allows users to dynamically search for courses, view detailed information, and interact with the content without page refreshes. The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ✨ Features

- **Course Search:** A search bar to find courses by name.
- **Dynamic Course Display:** Formatted course listings are created dynamically based on search results.
- **Detailed Course View:** Click on a course to see full details, including modules, lecturers, venues, study guides, and YouTube video links.
- **Interactive Module Tracking:** Mark modules as "completed," which are then visually distinguished and listed in a dedicated section.
- **Print Functionality:** A "Print Course" button to open the print dialog for the current course details.
- **Course Enrollment:** An "Enroll" button that leads to a validated enrollment form, followed by a countdown timer to the course start date.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
